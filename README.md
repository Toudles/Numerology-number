Numerology is the "study of the purported mystical or special relationship between a number and observed or perceived events." It has been used throughout human history as a way to attach meaning to a name, object or event using mathematics. It is considered a "pseudoscience" by modern scientists since it has no basis in observable phenomena. With that said, it makes a great programming challenge so we're going to go with it! :)

What you want to do for this project is to ask the user to type in their name. Next, you will need to use a technique called "theosophical reduction" to convert their name into a number. With this technique we assign each letter of the alphabet its own number. For example, the letter "a" is equal to the number 1. "b" = 2, "c" = 3, "z" = 26, etc. You should ignore non-alphabetic characters (i.e. numbers, spaces and special characters)

Once you've gotten all of the letters converted into numbers you can add them up into one single number. This is the "numerology number" for the name that the user entered.

Classic numerology ascribes meaning to the following numbers:

0 = emptiness, nothingness, blank
1 = independence, loneliness, creativity, originality, dominance, leadership, impatience
2 = quiet, passive, diplomatic, co-operation, comforting, soothing, intuitive, compromising, patient
3 = charming, outgoing, self expressive, extroverted, abundance, active, energetic, proud
4 = harmony, truth, justice, order discipline, practicality
5 = new directions, excitement, change, adventure
6 = love, harmony, perfection, marriage, tolerance, public service
7 = spirituality, completeness, isolation, introspection
8 = organization, business, commerce, new beginnings
9 = romatic, rebellious, determined, passionate, compassionate
